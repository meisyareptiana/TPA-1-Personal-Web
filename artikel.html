        <h1>Article Recommendations</h1>
        <p>Here are some recommended articles to learn about Web Development that I got during my course at skilvul :</p>
        <dl class="artikel">
            <dt><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/">1. Mdn Web Docs</a></dt>
            <dd>This website has complete documentation on web development, such as CSS, HTML, and Javascipt. They have a mission to provide a blueprint for a better internet and empower a new generation of developers and content creators to build it. </dd>
            <dt><a href="https://flukeout.github.io/">2. CSS Dinner</a></dt>
            <dd>This is a very exciting website. On this website we can play while learning the use of CSS Selector with 32 game levels provided. On this website, there are pictures as illustrations to do quizzes about CSS Selector, and accompanied by instructions or explanations.</dd>
            <dt><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/">3. W3Schools Online Web Tutorial</a></dt>
            <dd>W3Schools is optimized for learning, testing, and training. In addition to having complete materials about several programming languages, there is also an online compiler that can be used to try directly related materials on the website. Different from Mdn Webs Docs which only focuses on web platform technology documentation, this website has more programming language documentation as well as other IT-related materials. The three main contents offered by W3Schools are Learn, Reference, and Get Certified.</dd>
            <dt><a href="https://cssbattle.dev/">4. CSS Battle</a></dt>
            <dd>It can be said that this website has the same concept as CSS Dinner. Where we can learn by doing some stage quizzes accompanied by image illustrations. But what distinguishes this website from CSS Dinner is that it has more battle stages with different CSS materials, not just CSS selectors.</dd>
